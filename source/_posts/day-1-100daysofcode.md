I am going to be jumping right into getting started with [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/). <!-- more --> If you haven't heard of the challenge before, it is really straight-forward:
1. Code for a minimum of an hour a day.
2. Publish your progress online.


Each of these entries will be a bit longer than what you'd normally expect in a progress update, mostly because I think it'll do a good job of reinforcing whatever I learned that day. 

With that being said, here's what I managed to complete on Day 1:
- Finished reading Chapter 11 of Python Crash Course. I've messed around with Python enough that I was able to skip through a good chunk of this book. I wish this was the first resource I picked up, it was definitely my favorite out of a lot of the other options out there.
- Completed Basic HTML and HTML5 of Responsive Web Design on freeCodeCamp. Similarly to Python: I've messed around enough with HTML/CSS to power through this entire section.

After those two were all said and done, I moved onto getting started with my first real project in Python: a cryptocurrency portfolio tracker. I have an idea in my head for something like a roadmap that I'll be using to guide me along, which might be worth getting down on paper soon. 

Thanks to [@rishi556](https://peakd.com/@rishi556), I was able to get the API links for pulling prices on PancakeSwap (for BSC), and CoinGecko (for non-BSC):
- PancakeSwap: https://api.pancakeswap.finance/api/v1/price
- CoinGecko: https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/ethereum/contract/

I didn't spend too much time on it, as it was already approaching 4 AM (which also explains the typo), but this is what I have so far:

My next steps are to:
- Have the program continue to run after a search, giving the user the ability to quit if they want to.
- Add functionality for non-BSC tokens.
- Add input checks to make sure that a token or token address is being input.
- Add a 'favorites' list that the user can change.

Anyway, I think that'll be it for Day 1. Let me know what you think of the format. I am planning for my posts to get more complex as time goes on.
